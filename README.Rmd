# autotest

The goal of autotest is automatic testing of statistical tests.

## Installation

You can install the development version of autotest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fdutine79/autotest")
```

or simply install [loadenv](https://github.com/fdutine79/loadenv) and put a reference in your `packages` list when using `loadenv::load_environment(packages)`:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fdutine79/loadenv")

packages <- c(
  "fdutine79/autotest"
)
loadenv::load_environment(packages)
```

## Test functions

autotest provides various standard statistical test functions. The correct tests, depending on sample size, normality, homogeneity, and various other parameters are selected automatically. You will be free of running `levene.test()`to get homogeneity and there is no need to analyse every distribution visually for normality (even sometimes you are prompted to do so).

Start with loading autotest or use the [loadenv](https://github.com/fdutine79/loadenv) package as described above.

``` r
library(autotest)
```

### Test for normality

Based on a sample dependent `normality_table.R`, the function `test_normality()` performs a check if a numeric sample can be considered normal or not. Included are 13 different statistical normality methods. Expected is a numeric vector. The result returns a list of all parameters to be used in your own functions or for reporting purposes.

#### Examples

First let us check normality for `ToothGrowth$len`:

``` r
test <- test_normality(ToothGrowth$len)
```

Then let us report the result for quick identification. Just wrap the `$result` in `cat()`.

``` r
cat(test$result)
```

At last show a full report of the function:

``` r
report(test)
```

Please be advised that statistical analysis for normality might be incorrect or biased. That is why it is recommended not only to rely on the statistical results but also your vision. In case of antithetical results of multiple tests applied (that happens from time to time), you will therefore be prompted to view the distribution and make the decision yourself.

Feel free to explore all other parameters, included in the list:

``` r
View(test)
```

### Test correlation

Pearson, Spearmann, Kendall? Let the data decide! The function `test_correl()` expects two numeric arguments. Be advised to put the x-axis variable first (for plotting reasons).

Both variables must be normal, as proven by `test_normality()` function to pass requirements for Pearson. Sample size must be $\ge 30$ to pass Pearson requirements and $\ge 10$ to pass for Spearman.

Feel free to add arguments `alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less")` and maximum acceptable p-level `alpha = .05`.

#### Examples

First let us test correlation between `ToothGrowth$len` and `ToothGrowth$dose`:

``` r
test <- test_correl(ToothGrowth$len, ToothGrowth$dose)

# By the way: it works like this as well:
# test <- test_correl("len", "dose", ToothGrowth)
# test <- test_correl(ToothGrowth[["len"]], ToothGrowth[["dose"]])
```

Then let us report the result for quick identification. Just wrap the `$result` in `cat()`.

``` r
cat(test$result)
```

At last show a full report of the function:

``` r
report(test)
```

Feel free to explore all other parameters, included in the list:

``` r
View(test)
```

### Test mean differences

Compare mean differences using `test_means()` (former `test_ttest()`). The function performs a parametric T- or Welch-Test or a non-parametric Wilcoxon, repectively Mann-Whitney U test. Give a metric variable as first parameter and a factored or character variable (grouping) as second parameter.

Dependent variable must be normal within each group as proven by `test_normality()` function, and $\ge 30$ to pass for parametric tests. Variances tested by `leveneTest()` (critical limit p-value $\ge .01$) must be homogeneous to pass for T-Test, else Welch-Test is used.

Arguments may be passed, such as `paired = bool`, `alternative = c("two.sided", "greater", "less")` and maximum acceptable p-level `alpha = .05`.

#### Examples

First let us test mean differences within `ToothGrowth$len` and `ToothGrowth$supp`:

``` r
test <- test_means(ToothGrowth$len, ToothGrowth$supp)
```

Then let us report the result for quick identification. Just wrap the `$result` in `cat()`.

``` r
cat(test$result)
```

At last show a full report of the function:

``` r
report(test)
```

Feel free to explore all other parameters, included in the list:

``` r
View(test)
```

### Test crosstabs

Use `test_crosstabs()` to run tests for categorical scales. The function requires two numeric or factored variables. For $2 \times 2$ contingency tables you might event want to test directed hypotheses by supplying `alternative = c("greater", "less")` (which is ignored to fall-back `"two.sided"` for larger contingency tables $df \gt 1$). For directed hypotheses, p-values are divided by $2$ (Pearson's chi-squared test only).

Continuity correction is applied for $2 \times 2$ contingency tables if the maximum number of values per row/column reaches below $40$. Minimum expected frequency must be $\ge 5$ to apply Pearson's chi-squared test, otherwise Fisher's exact test is used. Hybrid approximation for probabilities is applied in Fisher's test for larger than $2 \times 2$ tables.

`alpha = .05` may be passed as argument to set the maximum acceptable p-level.

#### Examples

First let us test crosstabs between `mtcars$cyl` and `mtcars$vs`:

``` r
test <- test_crosstabs(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$vs)
```

Then let us report the result for quick identification. Just wrap the `$result` in `cat()`.

``` r
cat(test$result)
```

At last show a full report of the function:

``` r
report(test)
```

Feel free to explore all other parameters, included in the list:

``` r
View(test)
```

### Test ANOVA

To test mean differences of multiple ($\gt 2$) groups, apply the `test_anova()` function. The function requires a metric dependent variable and a categorical independent grouping variable with more than two groups. The argument `alpha = .05` may be passed to set the maximum acceptable p-level.

All grouped values should pass normality as tested by `test_normality()` function, and size of $\ge 20$ to pass for parametric tests (ANOVA). Variances tested by `leveneTest()` (critical limit p-value $\ge .01$) must be homogeneous to pass for ANOVA, else One-Way-Test (Welch-Test) is used where variances are not necessarily assumed to be equal. As non-parametric test Kruskal-Wallis (KWH) rank sum test is applied.

Post hoc analysis is performed by Pairwise T-Test for parametric tests (ANOVA) and pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum Test for non-parametric tests (KWH).

#### Examples

First let us test analysis of variance with `iris$Sepal.Length` and `iris$Species`:

``` r
test <- test_anova("Sepal.Length", "Species", iris)
```

Then let us report the result for quick identification. Just wrap the `$result` in `cat()`.

``` r
cat(test$result)
```

At last show a full report of the function:

``` r
report(test)
```

Feel free to explore all other parameters, included in the list:

``` r
View(test)
```
